    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            For the past 4 years i have spend my time in the construction industry, applying my physical strengths to concrete and stone finshing.
            I have enjoyed the skills i have learnt during this time such as leadership, time managment and commincation.
            It's time for me to get started on a new path, a path i am most excited about. During the past 6 years I have also had the great opertunity
            to valunteer my time in a basketball association in Mundaring. I went from general memebr to an excutive memember helping mould and manage
            game equipment, teams and IT based equipment such as ipads, network devices and i have spent some time using microsft admin center.
        </p>
        <p>
            During High school I spent endless amounts of time learning computer networking and web devolpemnt.
            After several years I had the opertunity to be part of UWA/Trilogy Coding Bootcamp. Refreshing my old skills and learning new techniques has
            been an amazing experience and i am keen to put to them to use.
